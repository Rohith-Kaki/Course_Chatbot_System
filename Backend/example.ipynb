sold on Python until you’ve\\nlearned the language by reading the rest of this book and have done a project or two.', 'But before we jump into details, the first few pages of this book will briefly introduce\\nsome of the main reasons behind Python’s popularity.', 'To begin sculpting a definition\\nof Python, this chapter takes the form of a question-and-answer session, which poses\\nsome of the most common questions asked by beginners.', 'Why Do People Use Python?', 'Because there are many programming languages available today, this is the usual first\\nquestion of newcomers.', 'Given that there are roughly 1 million Python users out there\\nat the moment, there really is no way to answer this question with complete accuracy;\\nthe choice of development tools is sometimes based on unique constraints or personal\\npreference.', 'But after teaching Python to roughly 225 groups and over 3,000 students during the\\nlast 12 years, some common themes have emerged.', 'The primary factors cited by Python\\nusers seem to be these:\\nSoftware quality\\nFor many, Python’s focus on readability, coherence, and software quality in general\\nsets it apart from other tools in the scripting world.', 'Python code is designed to be\\nreadable, and hence reusable and maintainable—much more so than traditional\\nscripting languages.', 'The uniformity of Python code makes it easy to understand,\\neven if you did not write it.', 'In addition, Python has deep support for more advanced\\nsoftware reuse mechanisms, such as object-oriented programming (OOP).', 'Developer productivity\\nPython boosts developer productivity many times beyond compiled or statically\\ntyped languages such as C, C++, and Java.', 'Python code is typically one-third to\\none-fifth the size of equivalent C++ or Java code.', 'That means there is less to type,\\n3\\nless to debug, and less to maintain after the fact.', 'Python programs also run imme-\\ndiately, without the \\nlengthy compile and link steps required by some other tools,\\nfurther boosting programmer speed.', 'Program portability\\nMost Python programs run unchanged on all major computer platforms.', 'Porting\\nPython code between Linux and Windows, for example, is usually just a matter of\\ncopying a script’s code between machines.', 'Moreover, Python offers multiple op-\\ntions for coding portable graphical user interfaces, database access programs, web-\\nbased systems, and more.', 'Even operating system interfaces, including program\\nlaunches and directory processing, are as portable in Python as they can possibly\\nbe.', 'Support libraries\\nPython comes with a large collection of prebuilt and portable functionality, known\\nas the standard library.', 'This library supports an array of application-level pro-\\ngramming tasks, from text pattern matching to network scripting.', 'In addition,\\nPython can be extended with both homegrown libraries and a vast collection of\\nthird-party application support software.', 'Python’s third-party domain offers tools\\nfor website construction, numeric programming, serial port access, game devel-\\nopment, and much more.', 'The NumPy extension, for instance, has been described\\nas a free and more powerful equivalent to the Matlab numeric programming\\nsystem.', 'Component integration\\nPython scripts can easily communicate with other parts of an application, using a\\nvariety of integration mechanisms.', 'Such integrations allow Python to be used as a\\nproduct customization and extension tool.', 'Today, Python code can invoke C and\\nC++ libraries, can be called from C and C++ programs, can integrate with Java\\nand .NET components, can communicate over frameworks such as COM, can\\ninterface with devices over serial ports, and can interact over networks with inter-\\nfaces like SOAP, XML-RPC, and CORBA.', 'It is not a standalone tool.', 'Enjoyment\\nBecause of Python’s ease of use and built-in toolset, it can make the act of pro-\\ngramming more pleasure than chore.', 'Although this may be an intangible benefit,\\nits effect on productivity is an important asset.', 'Of these factors, the first two (quality and productivity) are probably the most com-\\npelling benefits to most Python users.', 'Software Quality\\nBy design, Python implements a deliberately simple and readable syntax and a highly\\ncoherent programming model.', 'As a slogan at a recent Python conference attests, the\\nnet result is that Python seems to “fit your brain”—that is, features of the language\\ninteract in consistent and limited ways and follow naturally from a small set of core\\n4 | Chapter 1: \\u2002A Python Q&A Session\\nconcepts.', 'This makes the language easier to learn, understand, and remember.', 'In prac-\\ntice, Python programmers \\ndo not need to constantly refer to manuals when reading or\\nwriting code; it’s a consistently designed system that many find yields surprisingly\\nregular-looking code.', 'By philosophy, Python adopts a somewhat minimalist approach.', 'This means that al-\\nthough there are usually multiple ways to accomplish a coding task, there is usually\\njust one obvious way, a few less obvious alternatives, and a small set of coherent in-\\nteractions everywhere in the language.', 'Moreover, Python doesn’t make arbitrary deci-\\nsions for you; when interactions are ambiguous, explicit intervention is preferred over\\n“magic.” In the Python way of thinking, explicit is better than implicit, and simple is\\nbetter than complex.', '*\\nBeyond such design themes, Python includes tools such as modules and OOP that\\nnaturally promote code reusability.', 'And because Python is focused on quality, so too,\\nnaturally, are Python programmers.', 'Developer Productivity\\nDuring the great Internet boom of the mid-to-late 1990s, it was difficult to find enough\\nprogrammers to implement software projects; developers were asked to implement\\nsystems as fast as the Internet evolved.', 'Today, in an era of layoffs and economic reces-\\nsion, the picture has shifted.', 'Programming staffs are often now asked to accomplish\\nthe same tasks with even fewer people.', 'In both of these scenarios, Python has shined as a tool that allows programmers to get\\nmore done with less effort.', 'It is deliberately optimized for speed of development —its\\nsimple syntax, dynamic typing, lack of compile steps, and built-in toolset allow pro-\\ngrammers to develop programs in a fraction of the time needed when using some other\\ntools.', 'The net effect is that Python typically boosts developer productivity many times\\nbeyond the levels supported by traditional languages.', 'That’s good news in both boom\\nand bust times, and everywhere the software industry goes in between.', 'Is Python a “Scripting Language”?', 'Python is a general-purpose programming language that is often applied in scripting\\nroles.', 'It is commonly defined as an object-oriented scripting language—a definition that\\nblends support for OOP with an overall orientation toward scripting roles.', 'In fact,\\npeople often use the word “script” instead of “program” to describe a Python code file.', 'In this book, the terms “script” and “program” are used interchangeably, with a slight\\n* For a more complete look at the Python philosophy, type the command import this at any Python interactive\\nprompt (you’ll see how in Chapter 2).', 'This invokes an “Easter egg” hidden in Python—a collection of design\\nprinciples

simpler top-level file and “program” to refer to a\\nmore sophisticated multifile application.', 'Because the term \\n“scripting language” has so many different meanings to different\\nobservers, some would prefer that it not be applied to Python at all.', 'In fact, people tend\\nto make three very different associations, some of which are more useful than others,\\nwhen they hear Python labeled as such:\\nShell tools\\nSometimes when people hear Python described as a scripting language, they think\\nit means that Python is a tool for coding operating-system-oriented scripts.', 'Such\\nprograms are often launched from console command lines and perform tasks such\\nas processing text files and launching other programs.', 'Python programs can and do serve such roles, but this is just one of dozens of\\ncommon Python application domains.', 'It is not just a better shell-script language.', 'Control language\\nTo others, scripting refers to a “glue” layer used to control and direct (i.e., script)\\nother application components.', 'Python programs are indeed often deployed in the\\ncontext of larger applications.', 'For instance, to test hardware devices, Python pro-\\ngrams may call out to components that give low-level access to a device.', 'Similarly,\\nprograms may run bits of Python code at strategic points to support end-user\\nproduct customization without the need to ship and recompile the entire system’s\\nsource code.', 'Python’s simplicity makes it a naturally flexible control tool.', 'Technically, though,\\nthis is also just a common Python role; many (perhaps most) Python programmers\\ncode standalone scripts without ever using or knowing about any integrated com-\\nponents.', 'It is not just a control language.', 'Ease of use\\nProbably the best way to think of the term “scripting language” is that it refers to\\na simple language used for quickly coding tasks.', 'This is especially true when the\\nterm is applied to Python, which allows much faster program development than\\ncompiled languages like C++.', 'Its rapid development cycle fosters an exploratory,\\nincremental mode of programming that has to be experienced to be appreciated.', 'Don’t be fooled, though—Python is not just for simple tasks.', 'Rather, it makes tasks\\nsimple by its ease of use and flexibility.', 'Python has a simple feature set, but it allows\\nprograms to scale up in sophistication as needed.', 'Because of that, it is commonly\\nused for quick tactical tasks and longer-term strategic development.', 'So, is Python a scripting language or not? It depends on whom you ask.', 'In general, the\\nterm “scripting” is probably best used to describe the rapid and flexible mode of de-\\nvelopment that Python supports, rather than a particular application domain.', '6 | Chapter 1: \\u2002A Python Q&A Session\\nOK, but What’s the Downside?', 'After using it \\nfor 17 years and teaching it for 12, the only downside to Python I’ve found\\nis that, as currently implemented, its execution speed may not always be as fast as that\\nof compiled languages such as C and C++.', 'We’ll talk about implementation concepts in detail later in this book.', 'In short, the\\nstandard implementations of Python today compile (i.e., translate) source code state-\\nments to an intermediate format known as byte code  and then interpret the byte code.', 'Byte code provides portability, as it is a platform-independent format.', 'However, be-\\ncause Python is not compiled all the way down to binary machine code (e.g., instruc-\\ntions for an Intel chip), some programs will run more slowly in Python than in a fully\\ncompiled language like C.\\nWhether you will ever care about the execution speed difference depends on what kinds\\nof programs you write.', 'Python has been optimized numerous times, and Python code\\nruns fast enough by itself in most application domains.', 'Furthermore, whenever you do\\nsomething “real” in a Python script, like processing a file or constructing a graphical\\nuser interface (GUI), your program will actually run at C speed, since such tasks are\\nimmediately dispatched to compiled C code inside the Python interpreter.', 'More fun-\\ndamentally, Python’s speed-of-development gain is often far more important than any\\nspeed-of-execution loss, especially given modern computer speeds.', 'Even at today’s CPU speeds, though, there still are some domains that do require op-\\ntimal execution speeds.', 'Numeric programming and animation, for example, often need\\nat least their core number-crunching components to run at C speed (or better).', 'If you\\nwork in such a domain, you can still use Python—simply split off the parts of the\\napplication that require optimal speed into compiled extensions , and link those into\\nyour system for use in Python scripts.', 'We won’t talk about extensions much in this text, but this is really just an instance of\\nthe Python-as-control-language role we discussed earlier.', 'A prime example of this dual\\nlanguage strategy is the NumPy numeric programming extension for Python; by com-\\nbining compiled and optimized numeric extension libraries with the Python language,\\nNumPy turns Python into a numeric programming tool that is efficient and easy to use.', 'You may never need to code such extensions in your own Python work, but they provide\\na powerful optimization mechanism if you ever do.', 'Who Uses Python Today?', 'At this writing, the best estimate anyone can seem to make of the size of the Python\\nuser base is that there are roughly 1 million Python users around the world today (plus\\nor minus a few).', 'This estimate is based on various statistics, like download rates and\\ndeveloper surveys.', 'Because Python is open source, a more exact count is difficult—\\nthere are no license registrations to tally.', 'Moreover, Python is automatically included\\nWho Uses Python Today?', '| 7\\nwith Linux distributions, Macintosh computers, and some products and hardware,\\nfurther clouding the user-base picture.', 'In general, though, \\nPython enjoys a large user base and a very active developer com-\\nmunity.', 'Because Python has been around for some 19 years and has been widely used,\\nit is also very stable and robust.', 'Besides being employed by individual users, Python is\\nalso being applied in real revenue-generating products by real companies.', 'For instance:\\n• Google makes extensive use of Python in its web search systems, and employs\\nPython’s creator.', '• The YouTube

the\\nsame Python language but execute programs in different ways.', 'CPython\\nThe original, and standard, implementation of Python is usually called CPython, when\\nyou want to contrast it with the

distribution, and have automatically on most\\nLinux and Mac OS X machines.', 'If you’ve found a preinstalled version of Python on\\nyour machine, it’s probably CPython, unless your company is using Python in very\\nspecialized ways.', 'Unless you want to script Java or .NET applications with Python, you probably want\\nto use the standard CPython system.', 'Because it is the reference implementation of the\\nlanguage, it tends to run the fastest, be the most complete, and be more robust than\\nthe alternative systems.', 'Figure 2-2 reflects CPython’s runtime architecture.', 'Jython\\nThe Jython system (originally known as JPython) is an alternative implementation of\\nthe Python language, targeted for integration with the Java programming language.', 'Jython consists of Java classes that compile Python source code to Java byte code and\\nthen route the resulting byte code to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).', 'Programmers\\nstill code Python statements in .py text files as usual; the Jython system essentially just\\nreplaces the rightmost two bubbles in Figure 2-2 with Java-based equivalents.', 'Jython’s goal is to allow Python code to script Java applications, much as CPython\\nallows Python to script C and C++ components.', 'Its integration with Java is remarkably\\nseamless.', 'Because Python code is translated to Java byte code, it looks and feels like a\\ntrue Java program at runtime.', 'Jython scripts can serve as web applets and servlets, build\\nJava-based GUIs, and so on.', 'Moreover, Jython includes integration support that allows\\nExecution Model Variations | 29\\nPython code to import and use Java classes as though they were coded in Python.', 'Because Jython is \\nslower and less robust than CPython, though, it is usually seen as a\\ntool of interest primarily to Java developers looking for a scripting language to be a\\nfrontend to Java code.', 'IronPython\\nA third implementation of Python, and newer than both CPython and Jython,\\nIronPython is designed to allow Python programs to integrate with applications coded\\nto work with Microsoft’s .NET Framework for Windows, as well as the Mono open\\nsource equivalent for Linux.', '.NET and its C# programming language runtime system\\nare designed to be a language-neutral object communication layer, in the spirit of Mi-\\ncrosoft’s earlier COM model.', 'IronPython allows Python programs to act as both client\\nand server components, accessible from other .NET languages.', 'By implementation, IronPython is very much like Jython (and, in fact, was developed\\nby the same creator)—it replaces the last two bubbles in Figure 2-2 with equivalents\\nfor execution in the .NET environment.', 'Also, like Jython, IronPython has a special\\nfocus—it is primarily of interest to developers integrating Python with .NET compo-\\nnents.', 'Because it is being developed by Microsoft, though, IronPython might also be\\nable to leverage some important optimization tools

corresponding part of the original byte code to speed your program’s over-\\nall execution.', 'The net effect is that, with Psyco, your program becomes much quicker\\nover time and as it is running.', 'In ideal cases, some Python code may become as fast as\\ncompiled C code under Psyco.', 'Because this translation from byte code happens at program runtime, Psyco is generally\\nknown as a just-in-time (JIT) compiler.', 'Psyco is actually a bit different from the JIT\\ncompilers some readers may have seen for the Java language, though.', 'Really, Psyco is\\na specializing JIT compiler—it generates machine code tailored to the data types that\\nyour program actually uses.', 'For example, if a part of your program uses different data\\ntypes at different times, Psyco may generate a different version of machine code to\\nsupport each different type combination.', 'Psyco has been shown to speed Python code dramatically.', 'According to its web page,\\nPsyco provides “2x to 100x speed-ups, typically 4x, with an unmodified Python inter-\\npreter and unmodified source code, just a dynamically loadable C extension module.”\\nOf equal significance, the largest speedups are realized for algorithmic code written in\\npure Python—exactly the sort of code you might normally migrate to C to optimize.', 'With Psyco, such migrations become even less important.', 'Psyco is not yet a standard part of Python; you will have to fetch and install it separately.', 'It is also still something of a research project, so you’ll have to track its evolution online.', 'In fact, at this writing, although Psyco can still be fetched and installed by itself, it\\nappears that much of the system may eventually be absorbed into the newer “PyPy”\\nproject—an attempt to reimplement Python’s PVM in Python code, to better support\\noptimizations like Psyco.', 'Perhaps the largest downside of Psyco is that it currently only generates machine code\\nfor Intel x86 architecture chips, though this includes Windows and Linux boxes and\\nrecent Macs.', 'For more details on the Psyco extension, and other JIT efforts that may\\narise, consult http://www.python.org; you can also check out Psyco’s home page, which\\ncurrently resides at http://psyco.sourceforge.net.', 'The Shedskin C++ translator\\nShedskin is an emerging system that takes a different approach to Python

approach to running Python code.', 'Shedskin is still somewhat experimental as\\nI write these words, and it limits Python programs to an implicit statically typed con-\\nstraint that is technically not normal Python, so we won’t go into further detail here.', 'Execution Model Variations | 31\\nInitial results, though, show that it has the potential to outperform both standard Py-\\nthon and the

“real” Python compiler, what they’re really seeking\\nis simply a way to generate standalone binary executables from their Python programs.', 'This is more a packaging and shipping idea than an execution-flow concept, but it’s\\nsomewhat related.', 'With the help of third-party tools that you can fetch off the Web, it\\nis possible to turn your Python programs into true executables, known as frozen bi-\\nnaries in the Python world.', 'Frozen binaries bundle together the byte code of your program files, along with the\\nPVM (interpreter) and any Python support files your program needs, into a single\\npackage.', 'There are some variations on this theme, but the end result can be a single\\nbinary executable program (e.g., an .exe file on Windows) that can easily be shipped\\nto customers.', 'In Figure 2-2 , it is as though the byte code and PVM are merged into a\\nsingle component—a frozen binary file.', 'Today, three primary systems are capable of generating frozen binaries: py2exe (for\\nWindows), PyInstaller (which is similar to py2exe but also works on Linux and Unix\\nand is capable of generating self-installing binaries), and freeze (the original).', 'You may\\nhave to fetch these tools separately from Python itself, but they are available free of\\ncharge.', 'They are also constantly evolving, so consult http://www.python.org or your\\nfavorite web search engine for more on these tools.', 'To give you an idea of the scope of\\nthese systems, py2exe can freeze standalone programs that use the tkinter, PMW,\\nwxPython, and PyGTK GUI libraries; programs that use the pygame game program-\\nming toolkit; win32com client programs; and more.', 'Frozen binaries are not the same as the output of a true compiler—they run byte code\\nthrough a virtual machine.', 'Hence, apart from a possible startup improvement, frozen\\nbinaries run at the same speed as the original source files.', 'Frozen binaries are not small\\n(they contain a PVM), but by current standards they are not unusually large either.', 'Because Python is embedded in the frozen binary, though, it does not have to be in-\\nstalled on the receiving end to run your program.', 'Moreover, because your code is em-\\nbedded in the frozen binary, it is more effectively hidden from recipients.', 'This single file-packaging scheme is especially appealing to developers of commercial\\nsoftware.', 'For instance, a Python-coded user interface program based on the tkinter\\ntoolkit can be frozen into an executable file and shipped as a self-contained program\\non a CD or on the Web.', 'End users do not need to install (or even have to know about)\\nPython to run the shipped program.', '32 | Chapter 2: \\u2002How Python Runs Programs\\nOther Execution Options\\nStill

import, with an extra assignment\\nto names in the importing component.', 'Technically, from copies a module’s attributes,\\nsuch that they become simple variables in the recipient—thus, you can simply refer to\\nthe imported string this time as title (a variable) instead of myfile.title (an attribute\\nreference).‡\\nWhether you use import or from to invoke an import operation, the statements in the\\nmodule file myfile.py are executed, and the importing component (here, the interactive\\nprompt) gains access to names assigned at the top level of the file.', 'There’s only one\\nsuch name in this simple example—the variable title, assigned to a string—but the\\nconcept will be more useful when you start defining objects such as functions and\\nclasses in your modules: such objects become reusable software components that can\\nbe accessed by name from one or more client modules.', 'In practice, module files usually define more than one name to be used in and

script’s\\nstreams from within the script.', 'The Python “hello world” program\\nLet’s start off with the usual (and largely pointless) language benchmark—the “hello\\nworld” program.', \"To print a “hello world” message in Python, simply print the string\\nper your version’s print operation:\\n>>> print('hello world')               # Print a string object in 3.0\\nhello world\\n>>> print 'hello world'                # Print a string object in 2.6\\nhello world\\nBecause expression results are echoed on the interactive command line, you often don’t\\neven need to use a print statement there—simply type the expressions you’d like to\\nhave printed, and their results are echoed back:\\n>>> 'hello world'                      # Interactive echoes\\n'hello world'\\nThis code isn’t exactly an earth-shattering piece of software mastery, but it serves to\\nillustrate printing behavior.\", 'Really, the print operation is just an ergonomic feature of\\nPython—it provides a simple interface to the sys.stdout object, with a bit of default\\nformatting.', \"In fact, if you enjoy working harder than you must, you can also code print\\noperations this way:\\n>>> import sys

longer:\\nimport sys\\nsys.stdout.write(str(X) + ' ' + str(Y) + '\\\\n')\\nwhich manually performs a string conversion with str, adds a separator and newline\\nwith +, and calls the output stream’s write method.\", 'Which would you rather code?', '(He\\nsays, hoping to underscore the programmer-friendly nature of prints....)\\nObviously, the long form isn’t all that useful for printing by itself.', 'However, it is useful\\nto know that this is exactly what print operations do because it is possible to reas-\\nsign sys.stdout to something different from the standard output stream.', 'In

and opened in append mode (so we add to its current content).\", 'After\\nthe reset, every print operation anywhere in the program will write its text to the end\\nof the file log.txt instead of to the original output stream.', 'The print operations are\\nhappy to keep calling sys.stdout’s write method, no matter what sys.stdout happens\\nto refer to.', 'Because there is just one sys module in your process, assigning\\nsys.stdout this way will redirect every print anywhere in your program.', 'In fact, as this chapter’s upcoming sidebar about print and stdout will explain, you\\ncan even

printed text can be routed and processed arbitrarily per a write method\\nyou code yourself.', 'This trick of resetting the output stream is primarily useful for programs originally\\ncoded with print statements.', 'If you know that output should go to a file to begin with,\\nyou can always call file write methods instead.', 'To redirect the output of a print-based\\nPrint Operations |

'We’ll see how to do this in Chapter 20, after we’ve had\\na chance to study some additional iteration concepts.', 'Dictionary construction with zip\\nIn Chapter 8 , I suggested that the zip call used here can also be handy for generating\\ndictionaries when the sets of keys and values must be computed at runtime.', 'Now that\\nwe’re becoming proficient with zip, I’ll explain how it relates to dictionary construc-\\ntion.', \"As you’ve learned, you can always create a dictionary by coding a dictionary literal,\\nor by assigning to keys over time:\\n>>> D1 = {'spam':1, 'eggs':3, 'toast':5}\\n>>> D1\\n{'toast': 5, 'eggs': 3, 'spam': 1}\\n>>> D1 = {}\\n>>> D1['spam']  = 1\\n>>> D1['eggs']  = 3\\n>>> D1['toast'] = 5\\nWhat to do, though, if your program obtains dictionary keys and values in lists at\\nruntime, after you’ve coded your script?\", \"For example, say you had the following keys\\nand values lists:\\n>>> keys = ['spam', 'eggs', 'toast']\\n>>> vals = [1, 3, 5]\\nOne solution for turning those lists into a dictionary would be to zip the lists and step\\nthrough them in parallel with a for loop:\\n>>> list(zip(keys, vals))\\n[('spam', 1), ('eggs', 3), ('toast', 5)]\\n>>> D2 = {}\\n>>> for (k, v) in zip(keys, vals): D2[k] = v\\n...\\n>>> D2\\n{'toast': 5, 'eggs': 3, 'spam': 1}\\nLoop Coding Techniques | 347\\nIt turns out, though, that in Python 2.2 and later you can skip the for loop altogether\\nand simply pass the zipped keys/values lists to the built-in dict constructor call:\\n>>> keys = ['spam', 'eggs', 'toast']\\n>>> vals = [1, 3, 5]\\n>>> D3 = dict(zip(keys, vals))\\n>>> D3\\n{'toast': 5, 'eggs': 3, 'spam': 1}\\nThe built-in name dict\\n is really a type name in Python (you’ll learn more about type\\nnames, and subclassing them, in Chapter 31 ).\", 'Calling it achieves something like a list-\\nto-dictionary conversion, but it’s really an object construction request.', 'In the next\\nchapter we’ll explore a related but richer concept, the list comprehension , which builds\\nlists in a single expression; we’ll also revisit 3.0 dictionary comprehensions  an alternative\\nto the dict cal for zipped key/value pairs.', 'Generating Both Offsets and Items: enumerate\\nEarlier, we discussed using range to generate the offsets of items in a string, rather than\\nthe items at those offsets.', 'In some programs, though, we need both: the item to use,\\nplus an offset as we go.', \"Traditionally, this was coded with a simple for loop that also\\nkept a counter of the current offset:\\n>>> S = 'spam'\\n>>> offset = 0\\n>>> for item in S:\\n...     print(item, 'appears at offset', offset)\\n...     offset += 1\\n...\\ns appears at offset 0\\np appears at offset 1\\na appears at offset 2\\nm appears at offset 3\\nThis works, but in recent Python releases a new built-in named enumerate does the job\\nfor us:\\n>>> S = 'spam'\\n>>> for (offset, item) in enumerate(S):\\n...     print(item, 'appears at offset', offset)\\n...\\ns appears at offset 0\\np appears at offset 1\\na appears at offset 2\\nm appears at offset 3\\nThe enumerate function returns a generator object —a kind of object that supports the\\niteration protocol that we will study in the next chapter and will discuss in more detail\\nin the next part of the book.\", 'In short, it has a __next__ method called by the next built-\\nin function, which returns an (index, value) tuple each time through the loop.', \"We can\\nunpack these tuples with tuple assignment in the for loop (much like using zip):\\n348 | Chapter

normally see this machinery because iteration contexts—\\nincluding list comprehensions, the subject of Chapter 14 —run the iteration protocol\\nautomatically:\\n>>> [c * i for (i, c) in enumerate(S)]\\n['', 'p', 'aa', 'mmm']\\nTo fully understand iteration concepts like enumerate, zip, and list comprehensions,\\nwe need to move on to the next chapter for a more formal dissection.\", 'Chapter Summary\\nIn this chapter, we explored Python’s looping statements as well as some concepts\\nrelated to looping in Python.', 'We looked at the while and for loop statements in depth,\\nand we learned about their associated else clauses.', 'We also studied the break and\\ncontinue statements, which have meaning only inside loops, and met several built-in\\ntools commonly used in for loops, including range, zip, map, and enumerate (although\\ntheir roles as iterators in Python 3.0 won’t be fully uncovered until the next chapter).', 'In the next chapter, we continue the iteration story by discussing list comprehensions\\nand the iteration protocol in Python—concepts strongly related to for loops.', 'There,\\nwe’ll also explain some of the subtleties of iterable tools we met
