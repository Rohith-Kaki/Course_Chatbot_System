It’s a searchable help file on Windows, and there is a search engine for the online version. Of these, the Library Reference is the one you’ll want to use most of the time. 386 | Chapter 15: The Documentation Interlude Web Resources At the official Python website ( http://www.python.org), you’ll find links to various Py- thon resources, some of which cover special topics or domains. Click the Documen- tation link to access an online tutorial and the Beginners Guide to Python. The site also lists non-English Python resources. You will find numerous Python wikis, blogs, websites, and a host of other resources on the Web today. To sample the online community, try searching for a term like “Python programming” in Google. Published Books As a final resource, you can choose from a large collection of reference books for Python. Bear in mind that books tend to lag behind the cutting edge of Python changes, partly because of the work involved in writing, and partly because of the natural delays built into the publishing cycle. Usually, by the time a book comes out, it’s three or more months behind the current Python state. Unlike standard manuals, books are also gen- erally not free. Still, for many, the convenience and quality of a professionally published text is worth the cost. Moreover, Python changes so slowly that books are usually still relevant years after they are published, especially if their authors post updates on the Web. See the Preface for pointers to other Python books. Common Coding Gotchas Before the programming exercises for this part of the book, let’s run through some of the most common mistakes beginners make when coding Python statements and pro- grams. Many of these are warnings I’ve thrown out earlier in this part of the book, collected here for ease of reference. You’ll learn to avoid these pitfalls once you’ve gained a bit of Python coding experience, but a few words now might help you avoid falling into some of these traps initially: •Don’t forget the colons. Always remember to type a : at the end of compound statement headers (the first line of an if, while, for, etc.). You’ll probably forget at first (I did, and so have most of my 3,000 Python students over the years), but you can take some comfort from the fact that it will soon become an unconscious habit. •Start in column 1 . Be sure to start top-level (unnested) code in column 1. That includes unnested code typed into module files, as well as unnested code typed at the interactive prompt. Common Coding Gotchas | 387 •Blank lines matter at the interactive prompt . Blank lines in compound state- ments are always ignored in module files, but when you’re typing code at the interactive prompt, they end the statement. In other words, blank lines tell the interactive\n",

Python includes syntax and tools to make documentation easier. Although this is something of a tools-related concept, the topic is presented here partly because it involves Python’s syntax model, and partly as a resource for readers strug- gling to understand Python’s toolset. For the latter purpose, I’ll expand here on docu- mentation pointers first given in Chapter 4 . As usual, in addition to the chapter quiz this concluding chapter ends with some warnings about common pitfalls and a set of exercises for this part of the text. Python Documentation Sources By this point in the book, you’re probably starting to realize that Python comes with an amazing amount of prebuilt functionality—built-in functions and exceptions, pre- defined object attributes and methods, standard library modules, and more. And we’ve really only scratched the surface of each of these categories. One of the first questions that bewildered beginners often ask is: how do I find infor- mation on all the built-in tools? This section provides hints on the various documen- tation sources available in Python. It also presents documentation strings (docstrings) and the PyDoc system that makes use of them. These topics are somewhat peripheral to the core language itself, but they become essential knowledge as soon as your code reaches the level of the examples and exercises in this part of the book. As summarized in Table 15-1 , there are a variety of places to look for information on Python, with generally increasing verbosity. Because documentation is such a crucial tool in practical programming, we’ll explore each of these categories in the sections that follow. 375 Table 15-1. Python documentation sources Form Role # comments In-file documentation The dir function Lists of attributes available in objects Docstrings: __doc__ In-file documentation attached to objects PyDoc: The help function Interactive help for objects PyDoc: HTML reports Module documentation in a browser The standard manual set Official language and library descriptions Web resources Online tutorials, examples, and so on Published books Commercially available reference texts # Comments Hash-mark comments are the most basic way to document your code. Python simply ignores all the text following a # (as long as it’s not inside a string literal), so you can follow this character with words and descriptions meaningful to programmers. Such comments are accessible only in your source files, though; to code comments that are more widely available, you’ll need to use docstrings. In fact, current best practice generally dictates that docstrings are best for larger func- tional documentation (e.g., “my file does this”), and # comments are best limited to smaller code documentation (e.g., “this strange expression does that”). More on doc- strings in a moment. The dir Function The built-in dir function is an easy way to grab a list of all the attributes available inside an object (i.e., its methods and simpler data items).

Of course, your author has been a card-carrying Python evangelist since 1992, so take these comments as you may. They do, however, reflect the common experience of many developers who have taken time to explore what Python has to offer. Chapter Summary And that concludes the hype portion of this book. In this chapter, we’ve explored some of the reasons that people pick Python for their programming tasks. We’ve also seen how it is applied and looked at a representative sample of who is using it today. My goal is to teach Python, though, not to sell it. The best way to judge a language is to see it in action, so the rest of this book focuses entirely on the language details we’ve glossed over here. The next two chapters begin our technical introduction to the language. In them, we’ll explore ways to run Python programs, peek at Python’s byte code execution model, and introduce the basics of module files for saving code. The goal will be to give you 18 | Chapter 1: A Python Q&A Session just enough information to run the examples and exercises in the rest of the book. You won’t really start programming per se until Chapter 4, but make sure you have a handle on the startup details before moving on. Test Your Knowledge: Quiz In this edition of the book, we will be closing each chapter with a quick pop quiz about the material presented therein to help you review the key concepts. The answers for these quizzes appear immediately after the questions, and you are encouraged to read the answers once you’ve taken a crack at the questions yourself. In addition to these end-of-chapter quizzes, you’ll find lab exercises at the end of each part of the book, designed to help you start coding Python on your own. For now, here’s your first test. Good luck! 1. What are the six main reasons that people choose to use Python? 2. Name four notable companies or organizations using Python today. 3. Why might you not want to use Python in an application? 4. What can you do with Python? 5. What’s the significance of the Python import this statement? 6. Why does “spam” show up in so many Python examples in books and on the Web? 7. What is your favorite color? Test Your Knowledge: Answers How did you do? Here are the answers I came up with, though there may be multiple solutions to some quiz questions. Again, even if you’re sure you got a question right, I encourage you to look at these answers for additional context. See the chapter’s text for more details if any of these responses don’t make sense to you. 1.

      " Class inheritance or attribute inheritance refers to the process of automatically searching for an attribute or method name across a hierarchy of classes, starting from the bottom up. In Python, when you refer to an attribute or method of an object, the interpreter performs an automatic search of the object's attributes and methods, as well as those of its parent objects, until it finds the desired attribute or method.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The search proceeds from the bottom up, meaning that the interpreter will first search the current object, then move up the hierarchy to search for an attribute or method in a parent object.\n",
      "* If an attribute or method is not found in the current object or any of its parent objects, the interpreter will raise a NameError.\n",
      "* Inheritance is also used to implement polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class.\n",
      "* In Python, you can use the dot (`.`) notation to access an attribute or method of an object, or use the `getattr()` function to access attributes and methods of an object that is not a Python object.\n",
      "* The inheritance search can also be influenced by the `locals` and `globals` modules, which allow you to define local or global variables that are accessible from any part of your code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of how inheritance works in Python:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "class Animal:\n",
      "    def sound(self):\n",
      "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "class Dog(Animal):\n",
      "    def sound(self):\n",
      "        return \"Arf!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "class Cat(Animal):\n",
      "    def sound(self):\n",
      "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "dog = Dog()\n",
      "cat = Cat()\n",
      "print(dog.sound()) # Output: Woof!\n",
      "print(cat.sound())  # Output: Meow!\n",
      "```\n",
      "In this example, the `Dog` and `Cat` classes inherit from the `Animal` class. The `Dog` class defines a new method `sound()` that overrides the method of the same name in the `Animal` class. When we create an instance of the `Dog` class (`dog = Dog()`), it inherits the `sound()` method from its superclass (`Animal`). Similarly, when we create an instance of the `Cat` class (`cat = Cat()`), it inherits the `sound()` method from its superclass (`Animal`).\n",
      "\n",
      "When we call the `sound()` method on the `dog` and `cat` instances, Python will search for the method in the current object (i.e., `dog` or `cat`) and then move up the inheritance hierarchy until it finds the method. In this case, since `Dog` inherits from `Animal`, the `sound()` method is found in the `Dog` class, and then the method is called on the `dog` instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this helps clarify how inheritance works in Python! Let me know if you have any further questions.\n"
