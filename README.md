# AI Based Chatbot System For Course Management

* It's an educational tool designed to bridge the gap between students at different schools and courses.
* The chatbot integration to provide topic explanations and answer course-related queries based on admin-uploaded materials. 

## Overview
This project combines a Flask backend and a React frontend to create a seamless course management system:
- **Admin Functionality**: Upload course materials (PDFs) via a secure admin interface.
- **Chatbot Integration**: Query uploaded content with natural language questions, powered by embeddings stored in ChromaDB and responses generated by the LLaMA2 model.
- **Goal**: Enhance student learning by providing instant, context-aware answers based on course-specific materials.
